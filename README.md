Altcoin - a rework of Litecoin, with various enhancements and changes.

 - 2.5 minute block targets
 - Base subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)
 - Base reward of 50 coins, following the same timing as Bitcoin

Significant changes are:
 - Every block has a 'bonus' reward, based on the current difficulty. (1% of the current difficulty is added to the base reward)
 - Fast response to network hashing changes

At the time this coin was released, there was a significant number of Alternative
cryptocurrencies being created, without any idea of what they were changing, or why,
with them - justifiably - being labled a scam, or a pump'n'dump scheme. 

This coin has been tuned to be responsive to a modern fast-switching, profit-driven
network, and will avoid block chain stalls, and encourage larger use. 

All original development, from the fork onwards, is available on Github.
